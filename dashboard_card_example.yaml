#
# Per-session entities:
#   - switch.sonorium_{slug}_play     (play/pause)
#   - select.sonorium_{slug}_theme    (theme selector)
#   - select.sonorium_{slug}_preset   (preset selector)
#   - number.sonorium_{slug}_volume   (volume 0-100)
#   - sensor.sonorium_{slug}_status   (current status)
#   - sensor.sonorium_{slug}_speakers (speaker info)
