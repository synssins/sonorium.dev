**Multi-Zone Ambient Soundscape Mixer for Home Assistant - Development Build**

[![Add Repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsynssins%2Fsonorium-dev)

Sonorium lets you create immersive ambient audio environments throughout your home. Stream richly layered soundscapes—from distant thunder and rainfall to forest ambiance and ocean waves—to any combination of media players in your Home Assistant setup.

## Current Development (v1.1.5-dev)

**Active Work:**
- **Broadcast Audio Model** - Rewrote channel streaming to use a radio-station model. All speakers tuned to the same channel hear the exact same audio stream, joining at the current playback position rather than starting their own independent streams.
- **Track Presence Control** - Tracks now have a "presence" setting (0-100%) that controls how often they appear in the mix, independent of volume. Low presence tracks fade in and out naturally rather than playing constantly.

**Recent Changes:**
- Reduced loop crossfade duration to 1.5 seconds for smoother single-track themes
- Track mixer UI now adapts width to content
- Added visible fill bars to presence sliders
- Shared audio generator with broadcast buffer for synchronized multi-speaker playback

## Acknowledgements

Sonorium is a fork of [Amniotic](https://github.com/fmtr/amniotic) by [fmtr](https://github.com/fmtr). The original Amniotic project laid the groundwork for this addon with its innovative approach to ambient soundscape mixing in Home Assistant. We're grateful for the time, effort, and creativity that went into building the foundation that Sonorium is built upon.

## Why Ambient Sound?

Ambient soundscapes aren't just background noise—they're a powerful tool for mental wellness and productivity. Research shows that ambient sounds can help with:

- **ADHD & Focus**: White noise and nature sounds can improve concentration by providing consistent auditory input that helps filter out distracting sounds. Studies suggest that background noise may trigger [stochastic resonance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6481398/), potentially enhancing cognitive performance in individuals with ADHD.

- **Misophonia**: For those triggered by specific sounds, [ambient masking](https://www.getinflow.io/post/sound-sensitivity-and-adhd-auditory-processing-misophonia) with nature sounds or white noise can help "cover" trigger sounds and reduce emotional responses.

- **Sensory Processing**: Individuals with [sensory processing differences](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17436843/), including those on the autism spectrum, may benefit from controlled ambient environments that provide predictable, soothing auditory input.

- **Anxiety & Stress**: Nature sounds like rain, ocean waves, and forest ambiance have been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress hormones.

- **Sleep**: Consistent ambient sound can mask disruptive noises and create a sleep-conducive environment.

- **Work & Study**: The "coffee shop effect"—moderate ambient noise can boost creative thinking and sustained attention.

- **Crossfade Looping**: Seamless loops with equal-power crossfades
- **Play/Pause/Stop**: Full transport controls per channel

### Modern Web Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes

- **Drag & Drop**: Upload audio files directly through the UI
- **Speaker Browser**: Visual hierarchy of floors, areas, and speakers

### Home Assistant Integration
- **Sidebar Access**: Appears in your HA sidebar for quick access
- **Ingress Support**: Secure access through Home Assistant's authentication
- **Media Player Discovery**: Automatically finds all media_player entities
- **Area & Floor Awareness**: Speakers organized by Home Assistant areas and floors

## Audio Setup

Create theme folders in `/media/sonorium/` with your audio files:

```
/media/sonorium/
├── Thunder/
│   ├── distant_thunder_1.mp3
│   ├── distant_thunder_2.mp3
│   └── rain_on_roof.mp3
├── Forest/
│   ├── birds_morning.mp3
│   ├── wind_leaves.mp3
│   └── stream_babbling.mp3
├── Ocean/
│   ├── waves_gentle.mp3
│   └── seagulls.mp3
└── Rain/
    └── steady_rain.mp3  (single files loop seamlessly!)
```

**Supported formats:** `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`

**Single-File Themes:** Themes with one audio file loop seamlessly using crossfade blending—no jarring restarts!

## Quick Start

1. **Install** the addon and start it
2. **Add Audio** to `/media/sonorium/` (create theme folders with audio files)
3. **Open Sonorium** from your Home Assistant sidebar
4. **Create a Channel**: Click "New Channel", select a theme and speakers
5. **Play**: Hit the play button and enjoy your ambient soundscape

## How It Works

### Channels
A channel is an independent audio stream. Each channel:
- Plays one theme at a time
- Streams to one or more speakers
- Has its own volume control
- Can be started/stopped independently

Any media player that supports HTTP audio streams can tune into an active channel's stream URL.

### Audio Mixing
When you play a theme:
1. All audio files in that theme folder are loaded
2. Sonorium mixes all tracks together in real-time using sqrt(n) normalization
3. The mix streams to your selected speakers
4. Tracks loop with 1.5-second equal-power crossfades for seamless playback

## Configuration

### Addon Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `sonorium__stream_url` | `http://homeassistant.local:8008` | Base URL for streams |
| `sonorium__path_audio` | `/media/sonorium` | Path to theme folders |
| `sonorium__max_channels` | `6` | Maximum concurrent channels (1-10) |

### Web UI Settings

Access Settings from the sidebar to configure:
- **Crossfade Duration**: Blend time between loops (0-10 seconds)
- **Default Volume**: Initial volume for new channels
- **Master Gain**: Global output level
- **Speaker Availability**: Enable/disable specific speakers from Sonorium

## API Reference

Sonorium provides a REST API for integration and automation:

### Streams
- `GET /stream/{theme_id}` - Direct audio stream for a theme
- `GET /stream/channel{n}` - Audio stream for channel N

### Channels
- `GET /api/channels` - List all channels
- `POST /api/sessions` - Create a new channel/session
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/play` - Start playback
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/stop` - Stop playback
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/volume` - Set volume

### Themes
- `GET /api/themes` - List all themes
- `POST /api/themes/create` - Create a new theme
- `POST /api/themes/{id}/upload` - Upload audio file

### Status
- `GET /api/status` - Current system status

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound
- Check that your media player supports HTTP audio streams
- Verify the stream URL is accessible from your speaker
- Check the channel volume and master gain aren't set to 0

### Speakers Not Showing
- Ensure speakers are media_player entities in Home Assistant
- Check that speakers aren't disabled in Sonorium settings
- Try refreshing speakers from the Settings page

### Theme Not Loading
- Verify audio files are in supported formats
- Check file permissions on `/media/sonorium/`
- Look for errors in the addon logs
