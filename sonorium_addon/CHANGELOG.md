# Changelog

All notable changes to Sonorium are documented here.

## [2.0.0b4] - 2024-12-11

### Fixed
- **Multi-client streaming**: Each speaker now gets an independent audio generator, fixing "generator already executing" errors when multiple speakers connect to the same channel
- Per-client crossfading when themes change mid-playback

### Changed
- Channel architecture refactored: Channel tracks theme state, ChannelStream handles per-client audio generation
- Thread-safe theme changes via version counter mechanism

## [2.0.0b3] - 2024-12-11

### Fixed
- Route ordering: `/stream/channel{n}` now correctly registered before `/stream/{id}` catch-all

### Added
- Channel-based streaming endpoints
- Theme crossfading within channels (3-second equal-power crossfade)

## [2.0.0b2] - 2024-12-11

### Added
- `Channel` class for persistent streaming with theme management
- `ChannelManager` for channel pool management
- `max_channels` configuration option (1-10, default 6)
- Channel integration with SessionManager
- `/api/channels` endpoints for channel status

### Changed
- Sessions now use channel-based URLs (`/stream/channel{n}`) instead of theme URLs
- SessionManager tracks channel assignments per session

## [2.0.0b1] - 2024-12-11

### Added
- **Multi-zone session management**: Create multiple simultaneous playback sessions
- **Speaker groups**: Save speaker configurations by floor, area, or individual device

- **v2 Web UI**: Modern interface for session and speaker management
- **Speaker hierarchy**: Floor → Area → Speaker organization from HA registry
- **State persistence**: Sessions and groups survive addon restarts

### Changed
