## Why Ambient Sound?

Ambient soundscapes aren't just background noise—they're a powerful tool for mental wellness and productivity:

- **ADHD & Focus**: Background noise can improve concentration by providing consistent auditory input
- **Misophonia**: Ambient masking helps cover trigger sounds
- **Anxiety & Stress**: Nature sounds activate the parasympathetic nervous system
- **Sleep**: Consistent ambient sound masks disruptive noises
- **Work & Study**: Moderate ambient noise can boost creative thinking
