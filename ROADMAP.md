# Sonorium Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and development direction for Sonorium. Features are organized by priority and complexity.

## Current State (v1.0.0)

Sonorium v1.0.0 is a fully functional multi-zone ambient soundscape mixer for Home Assistant with:

- Multi-channel audio streaming (up to 6 concurrent channels)
- Theme-based audio organization with favorites and categories
- Flexible speaker selection (individual, area, floor, or custom groups)
- Modern web interface with dark theme
- Home Assistant sidebar integration via ingress
- REST API for automation

---

## Near-Term Goals

### Home Assistant Entity Integration

**Goal:** Expose each configured channel as a controllable Home Assistant entity.

**Features:**
- Each channel becomes a `media_player` entity in Home Assistant
- Control channels directly from HA dashboards, automations, and scripts
- Entity attributes include:
  - Current theme
  - Volume level
  - Playback state (playing/stopped/paused)
  - Target speakers
- Services for:
  - `sonorium.play` / `sonorium.stop`
  - `sonorium.set_theme`
  - `sonorium.set_volume`
  - `sonorium.set_speakers`

**Use Cases:**
- Add Sonorium controls to any Lovelace dashboard
- Create automations like "Play rain sounds when it's bedtime"
- Voice control via Google Home / Alexa: "Hey Google, play forest sounds in the bedroom"
- Include in scenes: "Movie Night" scene stops all ambient audio

### Automatic Theme Cycling

**Goal:** Automatically rotate through themes on a schedule.

**Features:**
- Per-channel cycling configuration
- Configurable interval (e.g., change theme every 30 minutes)
- Two modes:
  - **Sequential**: Cycle through themes in order
  - **Random**: Pick themes randomly
- Optional theme playlist: specify which themes to cycle through
- Smooth transitions between themes during cycling

**Use Cases:**
- Variety during long work sessions
- Different ambient sounds throughout the day
- Randomized nature sounds for meditation

### Live Speaker Management

**Goal:** Modify speakers on an active channel without disrupting playback.

**Features:**
- Add speakers to a playing channel—new speakers immediately pick up the stream
- Remove speakers from a playing channel—remaining speakers continue uninterrupted
- Real-time speaker status showing which speakers are actively receiving the stream
- Graceful handling of speaker disconnections

**Use Cases:**
- Extend ambient sound to another room without restarting
- Remove a speaker when someone enters that room
- Dynamically adjust coverage based on presence detection

---

## Medium-Term Goals

### Standalone Docker Deployment

**Goal:** Run Sonorium outside of Home Assistant as a standalone Docker container.

**Features:**
- Official Docker image on Docker Hub
- Docker Compose configuration
- Environment variable configuration
- Optional Home Assistant integration (for speaker discovery)
- Manual speaker configuration for non-HA setups
- Web-based speaker management

**Use Cases:**
- Users without Home Assistant
- Dedicated media servers
- Integration with other home automation platforms
- Development and testing environments

### Per-Track Volume Control

**Goal:** Fine-tune the mix by adjusting individual track volumes within a theme.

**Features:**
- Volume slider for each track in a theme
- Mute/unmute individual tracks
- Save custom mix settings per theme
- Reset to default mix option

**Use Cases:**
- Reduce bird sounds while keeping rain prominent
- Create custom variations of existing themes
- Fine-tune problematic frequency ranges

### Schedule-Based Automation

**Goal:** Built-in scheduling without requiring Home Assistant automations.

**Features:**
- Time-based playback schedules
- Day-of-week configuration
- Sunrise/sunset triggers (when integrated with HA)
- Volume scheduling (quieter at night)

**Use Cases:**
- Automatic morning bird sounds
- Reduced volume after bedtime
- Different themes for workdays vs. weekends
