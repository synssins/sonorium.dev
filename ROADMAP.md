# Sonorium Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and development direction for Sonorium. Features are organized by priority and complexity.

## Current State (v1.1.52-dev)

Sonorium is a fully functional multi-zone ambient soundscape mixer for Home Assistant with:

- Multi-channel audio streaming (up to 6 concurrent channels)
- Theme-based audio organization with favorites and categories
- Flexible speaker selection (individual, area, floor, or custom groups)
- Modern web interface with dark theme
- Home Assistant sidebar integration via ingress
- REST API for automation
- **Broadcast audio model** - All speakers on a channel hear the same stream
- **Track mixer with advanced controls** - Per-track volume, presence, and playback mode settings
- **Playback modes** - Auto, Continuous, Sparse, and Presence modes for fine-tuned control
- **Plugin system** - Extensible architecture with built-in Ambient Mixer importer
- **Local browser preview** - Preview tracks and full themes directly in the browser
- **Theme presets** - Save and load named track configurations per theme
- **UUID-based theme identification** - Portable themes that survive folder renames

---

## Recently Completed

### Theme Presets with Channel Support (v1.1.52-dev)
- Save current track settings as named presets
- Load, update, rename, delete, and export presets
- Import presets via JSON for community sharing
- Set default preset per theme (auto-loads when theme selected)
- **Channel preset selection** - Select preset directly on channel cards
- Presets persist in theme's metadata.json (portable with theme)
- Preset changes apply immediately to playing channels

### UUID-Based Theme Identification (v1.1.52-dev)
- Themes identified by persistent UUID stored in metadata.json
- Themes survive folder renames - all settings follow the theme
- Favorites, categories, track settings, and presets stored per-theme
- Portable theme packages that work across installations

### Home Assistant Entity Integration (v1.1.28-dev)
- Custom integration exposes channels as `media_player` entities
- `media_player.sonorium_channel_1` through `media_player.sonorium_channel_6`
- Control channels from HA dashboards, automations, and scripts
- Select source (theme) from dropdown, play/stop controls
- Dashboard YAML examples included

### Plugin System (v1.1.28-dev)
- Extensible plugin architecture with hot-loading
- Built-in Ambient Mixer plugin for importing soundscapes from ambient-mixer.com
- Plugin enable/disable controls in Settings
- Plugin upload and management UI

### Local Browser Preview (v1.1.28-dev)
- Preview individual tracks in the track mixer
- Preview full theme mix directly in browser
- Volume control and play/pause for theme preview
- No speaker required - plays on the device viewing the UI

### Live Speaker Management (v1.1.28-dev)
- Add speakers to a playing channel - instantly syncs to current position
- Remove speakers from a playing channel - remaining speakers continue uninterrupted
- All speakers hear identical audio (broadcast model)

### Track Mixer with Advanced Controls (v1.1.17-dev)
- Per-track volume control independent of presence
- Per-track playback mode selection (Auto, Continuous, Sparse, Presence)
- Seamless loop option (disable crossfade) per track
- Advanced settings panel with gear toggle
- Configurable short file threshold per theme

### Broadcast Audio Model (v1.1.5-dev)
Radio-station style streaming where all speakers tuned to the same channel hear identical audio. New speakers join at the current playback position rather than starting independent streams.

### Track Presence Control (v1.1.4-dev)
Per-track "presence" setting (0-100%) that controls how often a track appears in the mix. Low presence tracks fade in and out naturally using equal-power crossfades.

- Smooth crossfade transitions between themes during cycling

**Use Cases:**
- Variety during long work sessions
- Different ambient sounds throughout the day
- Randomized nature sounds for meditation

### Theme Export/Import

**Goal:** Package themes for sharing and backup.

**Features:**
- Zip archive format containing audio files + metadata JSON
- Self-contained, shareable packages
- Presets bundled in export, travel with theme
- Versioning in export metadata for future compatibility

### Advanced Track Settings UI Redesign

**Goal:** Improve the track mixer interface for better usability and information density.

**Features:**
- Two-row layout per track: Volume slider above Presence slider
- Labels positioned to the left of each slider
- Track name with word wrap to prevent excessive width
- Playback mode dropdown between track name and sliders
- Grid-aligned UI elements for visual consistency
- Seamless loop checkbox for perfectly looped tracks
- Fixed-width panel that doesn't stretch to fill the page

**Use Cases:**
- See full track names without truncation
- Quickly compare settings across tracks
- More intuitive control layout

### Auto-Refresh After Plugin Import

**Goal:** Automatically refresh the theme list when a plugin imports new content.

**Features:**
- Plugin API hook to trigger theme refresh
- UI updates immediately after import completes
- Toast notification of new themes added

**Use Cases:**
- Seamless workflow when importing from Ambient Mixer
- No manual refresh needed after plugin operations

---

## Medium-Term Goals

### Quality of Life Features

**UI/UX:**
- Keyboard shortcuts (space=play/pause, arrows=volume, number keys=switch channels)
- Channel quick-duplicate (copy current channel config to new channel)
- "Now playing" toast/notification when theme changes
- Waveform or activity visualization showing active tracks in mix
- Mobile-friendly bottom nav or swipe gestures
- Drag to reorder channels

**Audio Playback:**
- Fade-to-stop option (gradual fadeout vs abrupt stop)
- Sleep timer per channel (stop playback after X minutes)
- Schedule/automation hooks (play theme at sunset, stop at midnight)
- Audio ducking when HA announces (TTS integration) - HA addon only
- Crossfade between themes when switching (not just hard cut)

**Theme Management:**
- Bulk import from folder/zip
- Theme preview (30-second sample without committing to a channel)
- "Random theme" mode within a category

## Long-Term Vision

### Standalone Application

**Goal:** Native desktop/mobile application that doesn't require a server.

**Features:**
- Electron-based desktop app (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Local audio playback (no streaming required)
- Cloud sync for themes and settings (optional)
- Mobile companion app for remote control
- System tray/menu bar presence (minimize to tray)
- Headless/daemon mode for server deployments
- Config file import/export (migration between instances)
- Built-in audio normalization on import (optional loudness leveling)
- Auto-start on boot option
- Web UI served locally (localhost:port) for configuration
- CLI controls for scripting (`sonorium play channel1 --theme Forest`)

**Cast Device Discovery:**
- **Google Cast (Chromecast)**: mDNS/DNS-SD discovery via `_googlecast._tcp.local`
- **AirPlay 2**: mDNS via `_airplay._tcp.local` and `_raop._tcp.local`
- **DLNA/UPnP**: SSDP discovery on `239.255.255.250:1900`
- **Snapcast**: JSON-RPC API over TCP (port 1705) for self-hosted multi-room
- Unified discovery service scanning all protocols
- Manual IP/port entry fallback for edge cases

### Raspberry Pi Deployment

**Mode 1: Streaming Server**
- Hosts Sonorium backend, serves HTTP audio streams to cast devices
- Run as systemd service or Docker container
- Pi 4 recommended for multiple concurrent channels
- Pi Zero 2 W minimum (single channel, light load)
- Wired ethernet preferred for multi-zone

**Mode 2: Dedicated Audio Output**
- Pi acts as endpoint with direct audio to amplifier
- DAC/Amp HAT options: HiFiBerry Amp2, IQaudio DigiAMP+, JustBoom Amp HAT
- I2S connection for high-quality audio (bypasses onboard audio)
- Can run headless as dedicated room player

**Hybrid Setup:**
- Pi 4 runs Sonorium server
- Multiple Pi Zeros with amp HATs as room endpoints
- Snapcast for synchronized multi-room from single source
- Or each Pi Zero tunes into Sonorium HTTP stream independently

### Multi-Room Synchronization

**Goal:** Synchronized playback across multiple speakers with precise timing.

**Features:**
- Sub-millisecond sync across speakers
- Support for speaker groups with sync compensation
- Seamless audio as you move between rooms
